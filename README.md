# unlambda
An Unlambda Interpreter written in Haskell.

##Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hellerve/unlambda.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hellerve/unlambda)

It is not finished yet, but you can execute Unlambda code pretty easily with it
by supplying the file containing the code via a command line argument.

##Building & Installing

Unlambda has a cabal toolchain, which means you can install it by issuing `cabal install`
if you have the tool installed.
